###***Calculator-David-Bryan***
In collaboration with David Flores and Bryan Martinez

We developed the BEL-DOFT 075s Calculator with a primary objective: to revolutionize the interface of our current internet calculator while infusing it with a vintage aesthetic, yet ensuring it retains all the functionalities of a cutting-edge calculator. Our approach was inspired by one main goal, to pioneer new design thinking.

On the technical front, we've integrated three additional features, alongside the optional challenge component. These invaluable enhancements to our calculator prompt me to request a top-tier evaluation, as we not only met; but exceeded expectations. We've crafted a distinctly retro calculator with a single line of code that functions seamlessly and breathes new life into the calculator and website interface.

>###IMPORTANT NOTES/ERROR HANDLING:
 >  Adding a new operator while another operator is already selected replaces the old operator with the new one.
 >  Starting off an equation with an operator shows the error 'ERR: invalid', except for square root operator.
 >  Can store a theoretically infinite amount of calculations in the memory, with Mem button.
