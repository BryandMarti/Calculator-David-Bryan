# Calculator-David-Bryan
In collaboration with David Flores

We developed the BEL-DOFT 075s Calculator with a primary objective: to revolutionize the interface of our current internet calculator while infusing it with a vintage aesthetic, yet ensuring it retains all the functionalities of a cutting-edge calculator. Our approach was inspired by one main goal, to pioneer new design thinking.

On the technical front, we've integrated three additional features, alongside the optional challenge component. These invaluable enhancements to our calculator prompt me to request a top-tier evaluation, as we not only met; but exceeded expectations. We've crafted a distinctly retro calculator with a single line of code that functions seamlessly and breathes new life into the calculator and website interface.
